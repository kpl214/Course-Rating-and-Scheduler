For college students who are looking for information about upcoming classes or tips to being successful in a certain class, our web application is a place where you can post and comment on classes you have already taken for other students to know what to expect before going into the class themselves. Unlike class descriptions you may find on a college website, our website will provide real experiences with students who have actually taken the class and can give practical input on how to be successful.
